# Revision notes 

---

### **Agile Software Development**
- **Definition of Agile Software Development:** refers to a group of software development methodologies based on iterative development, where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing cross-functional teams
- **Goals of Agile:** Minimize development risks, adapt to changing requirements, maintain budgets and timelines, ensure maintainability, and keep bug counts low.

---

### **Heavyweight Methods**
- **Characteristics of Heavyweight Methods:** These are regimented and heavily regulated methods like the Waterfall model, often slow and inefficient for developers.
- **Introduction to Lightweight Methods:** Agile began as "lightweight methods" to address inefficiencies and better align with effective software development practices.

---

### **Agile Software Development Components**
- **Agility:** Being quick, adaptable, and lightweight in processes, focusing on strong communication and flexibility to achieve results.
- **The Method:** Tasks are broken into small increments with short iterations (1-4 weeks), covering the full development cycle. Teams are cross-functional and emphasize face-to-face communication.

---

### **Roles and Communication**
- **Customer Representative:** Acts on stakeholders’ behalf to answer questions and review progress during iterations.
- **Daily Communication Routine:** Team members discuss tasks completed, planned tasks, and obstacles in daily stand-up meetings.
- **Emphasis on Working Software:** Progress is measured by working software, reducing the need for extensive documentation.
- **Information Radiators:** Techniques like dashboards keep stakeholders informed of project progress in real-time.

---

### **Control Variables**
- **Cost:** Optimal cost balances solving problems without overspending.
- **Time:** Sufficient time improves quality but too much can harm progress.
- **Quality:** Short-term compromises in quality can lead to long-term setbacks.
- **Scope:** Focusing on smaller scopes improves quality and delivery speed.

---

### **Set of Values**
- **Communication:** Enhancing communication to manage changing requirements.
- **Simplicity:** Building simple, adaptable solutions instead of overcomplicated systems.
- **Feedback:** Leveraging rapid feedback through unit tests and user input.
- **Courage:** Encouraging teams to rework inefficient code and highlight critical issues.

---

### **Agile Planning**
- **Focus on adapting to needs:** Agile prioritizes success by adjusting plans to align with project and customer requirements rather than rigid adherence to pre-set plans.

---

### **Agile Manifesto Principles**
- Emphasizes **individuals and interactions**, **working software**, **customer collaboration**, and **responding to change** over rigid processes, documentation, and contracts.

---

### **Comparison with Other Methods**
- **Adaptive vs. Predictive Methods:** Agile adapts to changing requirements, while predictive methods focus on fixed plans, making it hard to pivot.
- **Iterative Development vs. Waterfall Methodology:** Agile’s iterative approach delivers usable parts faster, unlike Waterfall, which requires completion to show progress.

---

### **Agile Methods**
- **Agile Modeling:** Flexible modeling techniques for software design.
- **Agile Unified Process (AUP):** A simplified version of the Unified Process.
- **Dynamic Systems Development Method (DSDM):** Business-focused agile methodology.
- **Extreme Programming (XP):** Focused on frequent releases and technical excellence.
- **Feature-Driven Development (FDD):** Centered on delivering client-valued features.
- **Open Unified Process (OpenUP):** An open-source agile process framework.
- **Scrum:** A popular framework with defined roles and iterations.

---

### **Agile Practices**
- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Writing tests before code.
- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Focus on expected behavior.
- **Code Refactoring:** Improving code without changing functionality.
- **Continuous Integration:** Frequently merging and testing code.
- **Pair Programming:** Two developers work on code together.
- **Planning Poker:** Team-based estimation technique.
- **RITE Method:** Rapid user testing for iterative design improvements.

---

### **Negative Impacts on Agile Projects**
- **Large-scale development:** Agile is challenging with large teams.
- **Distributed development efforts:** Coordination is harder with non-co-located teams.
- **Forced agile adoption:** Agile fails when teams are unwilling or untrained.
- **Mission-critical systems:** Agile might not suit high-risk projects like surgical software.

---

### **Agile Home Ground**
- Agile works best with:
  - **Low criticality**
  - **Senior developers**
  - **Frequent requirement changes**
  - **Small teams**
  - **A culture thriving on adaptability and chaos**

---

### **Iterative vs. Incremental Development**
- **Iterative Development:** Focuses on delivering unfinished versions of the product in cycles, refining it based on feedback (e.g., an e-commerce site built and refined in multiple cycles).
- **Incremental Development:** Delivers small, complete parts (increments) of the product, with each increment building on the previous one (e.g., adding user profiles in one release, shopping carts in the next).
